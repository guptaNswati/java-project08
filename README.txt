Brief description of submitted files:

cs1c/FHbinHeap.java
    - creates a heap of array and sorts it using min heap technique
    
cs1c/FHsort.java
    - contains multiple sorting algorithms to sort an array in place
    
cs1c/TimeConverter.java
    - Converts duration into a string representation
    
sorters/SimulateChunks.java
    - Reads the numbers from file and puts them in an array.
    - Then splits the array according to the given memory size
    - adds the chunks to the chunks array.
        
sorters/BasicSorter.java
    - Sorts an individual chunk in place using the static sortChunk() method.
    - The sorting algorithm depends on the number of elements.       

sorters/HeapTuple.java
    - Helper class for sorting input chunks via minHeap   

sorters/MinHeapArrayMerger.java
    - Using minHeap technique to sort the various chunks with respect to each other
    - writes the output to text file   
    
sorters/SortFileData.java
    - Reads multiple plain text files, which contain unsorted numbers.
    - Sorts the input files by dividing them into multiple chunks. 
    - Use min heap sorting techniques to sort all chunks with respect to each other.
